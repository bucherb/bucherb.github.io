Bernadette is a Computer Science PhD Student in the GRASP lab at University of Pennsylvania
working with Dr. Kostas Daniilidis. Prior to joining GRASP, Bernadette held various positions
at Lockheed Martin Corporation from 2014 to 2019, most recently working as a Senior Software
Engineer. During that time, she completed graduate courses in computer science from Georgia
Institute of Technology. She received her M.A. in Mathematics, M.A. in Economics, and B.S.
in Mathematics and Economics from the University of Alabama in 2014. Her research interests
focus on increasing sample efficiency in learning methods using visual sensory data
to make autonomous decisions. In particular, her current work focuses on designing intrinsic
rewards for exploration in reinforcement learning methods in order to increase sample efficiency
via adaptive sampling.
